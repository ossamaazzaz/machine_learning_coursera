# Machine learning - Coursera

This repository summaries my progress and contains my solutions for the given programming assignments while taking Andrew Ng's course on Coursera about machine learning.

# About the course

The course takes about 11 weeks to complete. And it is about how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems. It also covers how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as ‘debugging’ and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance.
